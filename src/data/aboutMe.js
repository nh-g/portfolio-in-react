    <p>
      I have 5 year experience working in Japan in business development, consulting, project management, for major players in
      HR and IT. <br />
      <br />
      Moving to Stockholm in late of 2018, I took a challenge starting a family
      in a new continent. And with a beautiful chaos since the born of my child and what-called new mom
      crisis, I find programming as a meditation to connect to my own sanity.
      <br />
      <br />
      My field of expertise which maybe of use to you, dear visitor, lies in the
      following: <br />ー UI/UX design <br />ー Responsive and interactive
      design <br />ー Web development
    </p>
