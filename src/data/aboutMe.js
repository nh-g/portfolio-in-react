      <p>
        I have 5 year experience working in Japan in business development,
        consulting, project management, for major players in HR and IT.
        Currently, I am brushing up my skill at Novare Frontend Camp. <br />
        {/* <br />
      Moving to Stockholm in late of 2018, I took a challenge starting a family
      in a new continent. And with a beautiful chaos since the born of my child and what-called new mom
      crisis, I find programming as a meditation to connect to my own sanity.

        the following: <br />
