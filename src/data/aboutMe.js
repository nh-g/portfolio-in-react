      <p>
        I have experience from working in a big media company in Japan - where I
        was working closely with the in-house development team and tech start
        ups in the US and Israel. I am fluent in English, Japanese, Vietnamese
        and agile scrum method.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am motivated by challenges, a fast learner and accustomed to working
        in a high paced environment. With a kind, social and flexible
        personality, I can be your team player. <br />
        {/* According to my closest colleagues and friends: I'm always positive,
        have a structured and analytical approach to problem solving and I'm a
        team player. On the personal side I was told to be a kind, and have a
        special vibe that people can confide in. I'm open to new opportunities
        and I believe I would thrive in a role between the intersection of
        business and technology to create products which enrich users life. */}
        {/* <br />
      Moving to Stockholm in late of 2018, I took a challenge starting a family
      in a new continent. And with a beautiful chaos since the born of my child and what-called new mom
      crisis, I find programming as a meditation to connect to my own sanity.
